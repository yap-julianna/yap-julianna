# About Me 

Hi! I'm Julianna. While I graduated with a double major in physics and mathematics, I realised that my one true love was in all things coding. As such, I took a leap and became a software engineer in August 2021. However, as expected, I am highly lacking in both experience and technical fields. As such, I have decided to do mini projects to supplement my learning. 

I am currently full-stack software engineer in a FinTech industry. That being said, I have yet to decide which industry to settle down in and am also open to the AI/Data Science industries. I am a fan of indie games too! As such, my projects will probably cover a bit of everything.

Currently, I am using a variety of websites to improve my technical skill. The skills I am currently working on include
- Networking
- MySQL code
- Python (my first love)
- C# (for my job)

Once I am done with this, I will then proceed to my mini projects and fill this repository up!

I am open to collaborations as well. As a very noob coder, it will be nice to work on a simple project with fellow noobies, helping each other along the way. Do reach me @ ysryupz@gmail.com if you have a cool project to work on and don't mind by lack of knowledge!
