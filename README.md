# About Me 

Hi! I'm Julianna. A full-stack software engineer who graduated with a degree in Physics and Mathematics. While my choice of degree was one of the best decisions of my life, I am aware that my lack of CS background is impeding me in my ability to write the best code possible. As such, I have decided to embark on a journey to relearn all the basics from scratch, building up my foundation and cultivating those good coding habits that us scientists don't seem to care about. 

Wish me luck!
